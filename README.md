This program gets the most recent revisions from any 
Wikipedia article. This took us 2 weeks to complete and 
it uses 2 classes to execute. The customer wanted to be 
able to look up any article and get what type of changes 
were made, date and time, and username of the user.
The WikipediaRevisionParser class gets the data from 
the Wikipedia API and makes it more pleasing to the eye.
WikipediaRevisionReader does the heavy work of getting the 
data from the API. And honestly so far those are all we needed
The hardest part was getting certain things to be compatible
with the version of Gradle we had.
